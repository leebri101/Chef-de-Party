## **Development Testing Phase**
During development phase of the quiz, I have been manually testing the site in two ways:-
    
1. Firstly by publishing the page via GitHub and sharing it with friends and family to test different outcomes and functions within a set controlled environment, and receive feedback on major and small changes that needed to be rectified.

1. Secondly, self testing the site to ensure that "I" as the creator know what to expect of the site.

### **Manual Testing Phase**
* During the testing phase, I used three different browsers to ensure consistency & cross-platform connectivity. The browsers used in the tests are:

  1. Chrome
  2. Opera GX
  3. Edge
