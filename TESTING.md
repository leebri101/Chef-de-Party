## **Development Testing Phase**
During development phase of the quiz, I have been manually testing project in two ways:-
    
1. Firstly by publishing the page via GitHub and sharing it with friends and family to test different outcomes and functions within a set controlled environment so that I can see and experiment with the different outcomes, and receive feedback on major and small changes that needed to be rectified.

1. Secondly, continuous self testing the site to ensure that "I" as the creator know what to expect of the site.

### **Manual Testing Phase**
* During the testing phase, I used three different browsers to ensure consistency & cross-platform connectivity. The browsers used in the tests are:

  1. Chrome
  2. Opera GX
  3. Edge
  
* 

* Google Chrome: 


* Opera GX:


* Microsoft Edge:


### **Known Issues and Solutions and Bugs**
* There is only a tiny amount of cosmetic issues which do not hinder the main functionality of the quiz but these will be noted down in their respected numbers for easier understanding. 

* Known Issues:
  1. Issue 1:![QUIZ TIMER](doc/screenshots/quiz-timer.png)
  Styling issue with spacing of timer function and text. 

  2. Issue 2:![Mobile-results](doc/screenshots/mobile-results.png) Rendering issue with mobile version of gif results.
  * 
    

* Solutions: 
  1. Solution 1: To possibly change some of the styling to ensure that there is more visibility to the user.

  2. Solution 2: To look for the exact same img/gif source or to possibly compress it to help speed up rendering time.

   

* Bugs: 
  * Bug 2:
